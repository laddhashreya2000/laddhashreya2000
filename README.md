### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Shreya Laddha, a fourth-year Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Bombay. I will be joining Google full-time in the month of July as a Software Engineer. My latest experience was as a Summer Analyst (2021) at Goldman Sachs. 

I have a keen interest in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, PCB design and communication systems. I am also the current Non-Technical Subsystem Head at IIT Bombay Student Satellite Program ([IITBSSP](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satlab/)).
